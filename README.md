Manipulations and statistics of grids in the GSLIB format

---

**subgrider** is a tool to perform some simple manipulations, data extraction, and computation of some statistics, of data structured in the [Geo-EAS format](http://www.gslib.com/gslib_help/format.html) (a.k.a. GSLIB format).

It was developed during the work for my MS thesis, entitled *Applying Spatial Bootstrap and Bayesian Update in uncertainty assessment at oil reservoir appraisal stages* (original title is in Portuguese), defended in [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](http://www.ist.eu), December 2010, Lisbon, Portugal. The corresponding extended abstract (in English) is available in arXiv: [arXiv:1702.04450](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04450).

After all this time, I finally make it available here, mainly for educational purposes (including for myself). The code is obviously poorly mainted, it only includes a simple text interface, which is in Portuguese, as well as the few comments in the code (eventually I may translate it to English). I cannot be held liable for any of its use or consequences of its use. It is released under GPLv3. I was not using git at the time, but I will do my best to recreate some of the development history, including the generated binaries.

I will be happy to receive and reply to any [issue](https://github.com/iled/subgrider/issues) on it.
